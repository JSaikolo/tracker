				<p id="saedBack">
					SAED is a newly established firm based in Zomba, Malawi. It was
					founded by two Pioneers from the University of Malawi (Chancellor
					College) after realizing the gap that exists in IT and Research
					Consulting services. It is irrefutable common knowledge that this is
					the era that demands more of digital services than analog, however
					this demands more professionalism and expertise. Besides that, true
					knowledge is thought to be best obtained by ethical researches which
					also need well-coordinated methodologies by great personalities with
					integrity. To conceal this technobabble, SAED is dedicated and
					committed in offering IT and Research Consulting Services with
					ultimate professionalism and expertise.
